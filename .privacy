This bot collects a little bit of information. it collects:
1) servers it is a member of
2) who owns said servers
3) Possibly user counts of servers in the future
4) channel and server ids to know where to post
5) when a command is executed the user who did it is logged along with the parameters they passed. These logs are stored locally and deleted after 7 days. This is for debugging purposes only.

No data is collected for the purpose of tracking, stalking, or harassing users. This data will also never be sold.
